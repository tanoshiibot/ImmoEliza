## Introduction
---
This project is a collaboration between the AI and the web dev promotions. The objective of this one is to give you the opportunity to improve your learning of PHP (web dev) || making an API (AI) by solving a real life need: create an app for the real estate agency named ImmoEliza.

Whereas HTML is good to create the visual interface of the form, you will need a backend script to actually process the data and compose the result via an API to be sent to the client.

## The Mission
---
The AI developers will create an API for the needed of this application.The web developers will develop an interface for the client "ImmoElize". The main process is about a collaboration between the AI and the web dev, you all have to sync both in order to know how to construct the form. The result of the request must return a house in 3D view.
